## Ultimate Hangman

* Ultimate Hangman is not your typical hangman game. Ultimate Hangman test not only your knowledge, but also your Under-Pressured skills as well. Now you may be asking how a childs game like hangman puts you under pressure. In normal hangman, the only goal is to guess the word with a a max-amount of tries. Ultimate hangman also has a max amount of tries but also a timer running down once you first click a letter and if you lose all your lives or the timer runs out, YOU LOSE. Think its easy, give it a TRY.
