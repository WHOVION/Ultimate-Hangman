### Pitch

Ultimate Hangman is not your typical hangman game. Ultimate Hangman tests not only your knowledge, but also your Under-Pressured skills as well. Now you may be asking how a simple game like hangman puts you under pressure. Well I'll tell you. In normal hangman, your only goal is to guess the word with a a max-amount of tries. Ultimate Hangman not only has a max amount of tries, but also a TIMER running down once you click a letter. If the timer runs out or you lose all your lives, YOU LOSE. Sounds easy, give it a [TRY](https://whovion.github.io/Ultimate-Hangman/).

### MVP

* Being able to add each body part of the hangman body after a mistake
* Having a well done layout using grid or flex
* Having a timer running down
* Making sure once the letter is clicked it can't be clicked again
* Having a functinal 'reset' button
* Having the letter that was cliked, if right, display on the word line
* Display "Winner" or "Loser" message over alphabet board or another spot
* Game will be based on a theme


### Stretch Goals

* Being able to randomize the alphabet board
* Potentially being able to display 'stressful' messages
* If player wants to play a thousand times, having enough words to keep game going
* Being able to choose different themes/word (themes: movies, word: Avengers)
* How to also allow pressing keyboard keys instead of in-game keyboard
* fixing up the look of the game, making background look like lined paper to have that nostalgic feel, making font look like handwriting
* potentailly adding music/sound, sound for when key is disabled


### Roadblocks

* How to place the right letter in the right spot of the word-line
* If letter appears twice in the word, how to display those letters in the word-line
* How to stop all functions after they win or lose
* How to make reset button reset everything
* disable keys after being pressed
* Functions


### Post-Project Reflection

As my first project, I am proud of what I have created. Using everything I've learned from this point and applying to create a game is definitely a big step in the right direction in my journey to becoming a software engineer. My code is definitely nowhere near perfect but with practice and repetition, I definitely can make the code look cleaner. The roadblocks I had listed previusoly definitely were roadblocks when I had to implement them and glad I was able to get help from people. I definitely need to improve my debugging and problem solving skils as well. Some problems I had really stressed me out and took me a while to find the problem and it was as simple as replacing a 5 to a 6. One thing I definitely can say helped me was reading the problem/code out loud. Doing this really helped my brain print a better picture of my situation and help me solve problems.
